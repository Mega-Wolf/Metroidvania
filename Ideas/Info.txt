Here, all ideas get shared
The ideas, that a new file for every new idea is generated
That way, it is easier to track what has been added/moved/changed
If ideas get rejected, they are moved to the Rejected folder. They are NOT deleted, since this way we can remember what was bad about them and why we have not done it

Horizontal Movement

Instead of just moving horizontally, the character will be able to walk up and down slopes (up to ~25°)
The orientation of the character therefore will also rotate
In fact, all walking things should be able to walk over slopes (maybe even up to higher angles (even negative), so the system has to have that in mind)

Maybe I can assume that turns won't be bigger than 90°?

Edges might be connected by a polygon or edge collider; however, since I don't know how the game will be constructed, it could be possible that this will not be true everywhere

For access reasons: Don't use more than one path of a PolygonCollider (use more colliders instead)

This script will somehow be used inside the character state machine, but since it might be used by other characters as well, it is very difficult to generate it.
Since the state machine stuff will already check physics it will very likely get collisions already as an input.

The ControllerState sets the target point and the target rotation
The Controller then checks if that movement is possible or if it has to stop  beforehand and executes the movement accordingly

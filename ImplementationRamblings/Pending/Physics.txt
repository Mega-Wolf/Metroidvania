Since I already want to do the character movement on my own, the whole pyhsics and trigger stuff could be disabled
Triggers would then have to be called on my own
This sound expensive, but I would not do the checks on my own; it would just mean calling the Physics2d.BoxCast etc. 
I do not want to have actual physics stuff in the game; therefore not having a physics engine wouldn't be bad
However, physics could be nice for projectiles, visuals, etc.
So for now I will let it in
PRobably all the stuff really affected by physics don't react on each other and therefore it mostly does not matter in which order they affect things
(this includes, that during one frame, a receiver should consume everything it collides with and take the most severe thing)

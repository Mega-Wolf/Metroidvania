This shall be an overview of how the movements would be designed if they were a state machine
Some stuff are animations some just static images
The state machine approach seems good but it also seems difficult to actually set it up



Grounded
- Idling -> Walking, Healing
- Walking
- Healing -> Idling (finsihed or aborting)






Air
- Rising
- Falling




Wall
- Idling
- Climbing



Hits can start during air and take back to the old state



Those are all animations:

- Idling (still picture)
- Walking

- Idle -> walking
- Walking -> Idle

- Hit in several directions

    //TODO; this should probably made abstract so that there are different GameManagers for playing and replaying
    // No: Playing and repalying means changing the InputManager
    // This thing means changing between edit mode and game mode
    // However, GameMode probably means doing nothing; so I just keep both in here
    // It probably should set the InputManager and maybe load a game (or replay)
